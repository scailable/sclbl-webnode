# sclbl-webnode

The Scailable webnode is a `.js` project that (will) allow users to

- Include a simple script to run (Scailable) WASIs in a webbrowser
- Control whether the data will be send to our taskmanager, or the task to the client
- Control where the `.wasm` is served from

> This repo will eventually become public.

> A bunch of code can probably be reused from [https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-jsnode](https://github.com/scailable/sclbl-jsnode)
